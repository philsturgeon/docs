title: Try Out Your OpenAPI with Interactive HTTP Clients

excerpt: Explore an API using OpenAPI-powered HTTP clients like Postman or Bruno.

Once your API consumers have the API documentation, the very next thing they're going to want to do is try interacting with this API. Some people like to do this by writing code, some like to try out the endpoint requests through some sort of interface that does the heavy lifting for them. 

That first group don't need much help, they just need an API key and off they go, but those who want to interact with an API need some sort of interface to do that. The are known as "API Consoles" or "API Clients", and are usually a visual list of endpoints, aware of all parameters and headers, required or optional, so people can play around with various requests and responses to see how the API works before committing to writing code. 

There are countless tools out there for this, but we're going to look at two in this tutorial: 

1. Postman
1. Bruno

## Postman

Postman is one of the original modern API consoles. It started off life as a Google Chrome extension for making simple HTTP requests, but has had huge amounts of time and money poured into making it one of the most popular API consoles around. It can be a fairly confusing tool to use as its attempting to cover so many different use cases, but you can use it as a simple API console if you ignore a lot of the other functionality. 

1. Create an account 

2. Create a workspace 

3. Import OpenAPI 




## Bruno

Bruno is a simple open-source alternative to Postman, which is entirely cloud-free. No accounts needed, just install the application with your favourite package manager, and get to work.

### Step 1.) Install Bruno

```
brew install bruno
```

### Step 2.) Import OpenAPI

As a Bump.sh customer you likely have an OpenAPI description stored as a document in your Git repository, or somewhere similar. We can use that document to kickstart a new Bruno "Collection".

Click "Import Collection", then "OpenAPI V3 Spec".

Find your OpenAPI description document (usually called `openapi.yaml`) and open it up in Bruno. 

You'll also be asked for a Location, which is going to be a local directory where this Bruno collection lives. I pop it in the project source code, and call it `bruno`. 

### Step 3.) Make requests

Go nuts, get, post, whatever.

### Configuring Multiple Environments

Bruno, just like Postman, can handle multiple environments. This could be used by customers to switch between Production and a Sandbox environment, or could be used by your API team to work with development or testing deployments of the API.

Find the Environments dropdown in the upper right corner, and click Configure to add two new environments. We'll call them local and production but they could be anything.

That's added the local environment, now for production.

Now that both environments have the same `host` variable, we can use it in our requests, replacing the hardcoded host name in the URL with the `{{host}}` variable syntax.

Using the dropdown switch in the top right we can control which values Bruno will use for this variable, and others, in the whole Bruno Collection, and not just in the URL. You'll need to update all URLs to do this manually, or open up the Bruno Collection in your favourite text editor and change everything manually. Be careful not to break anything!
