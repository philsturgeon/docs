- TOC
{:toc}

Your API is constantly evolving, with each new release creating a new entry in the changelog. API consumers need to be able to easily track what has changed between two dates or two branches of an API.

## Compare changelog entries

From the changelog, you can select two entries, including between two different branches, and compare them instantly.

On the change comparison page, each entry is identifiable by its release date and branch.

After selecting the two versions to compare, a detailed list of changes will appear.

You have the option to share the URL of this comparison directly with your API consumers or team members for reference if needed.
