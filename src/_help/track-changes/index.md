Tracking API changes is essential, both for users and developers.

[Changelog](/help/track-changes/changelog/) is a crucial feature of Bump.sh, recording the history of all deployments and detailing changes compared to previous versions.

The [branches comparison](/help/track-changes/branches-comparison/) allows you to compare two deployments, regardless of differences in dates or branches, making it easier to update your API users.

To ensure you don't miss any updates, Bump.sh offers [various notification options](/help/track-changes/follow-changes/), whether it's integration into your existing workflows or email notifications, you can be confident that you'll stay informed about important changes.
