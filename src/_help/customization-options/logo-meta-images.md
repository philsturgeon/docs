## Logo and favicon

You can upload your own logo and favicon on Bump.sh to customize your documentation with your brand or project colors.

From the "Customize UI" tab in the documentation settings, you can add your own logo and favicon.

To provide the best image quality, it is recommended to adhere to the following dimensions for your logo: 140px*36px.


## Meta images

A "meta image" typically refers to an image that is used as a preview image when a web page is shared on social media platforms and can be displayed in search engine results. You may have already heard it referred to as a "social media image." Meta images help make the links posted on social media platforms more attractive, especially when shared or displayed in posts.

### Add your own image

From the "Customize UI" tab in the settings of a documentation, you can add your own meta image.

It is advisable not to exceed a width of 1200px and to maintain the height between 600px and 700px for better integration on most platforms.

### Use the automated image generation

In case you don't have a visual you could use, Bump will automatically generate a meta image that will display your documentation name, logo and API type.

> First generation of this new social media image may take a bit, but any modification or change will start the generation process.

## Hub customization

All of these customization settings can be applied to all the documentation within a hub.

These options are available directly in the "Customize UI" tab in the hub settings.
