Bump.sh offers several methods for sorting your API operations to provide a smooth and coherent reading structure, based on either the tags or the endpoints of your API definition.

The OpenAPI specification allows for several types of requests:

- Endpoints are typically URLs that point to a specific resource on an API server. In OpenAPI, endpoints are stored under the `paths` resource.
- Webhooks are requests generated by the API and sent to an external server after a specific event has occurred. In OpenAPI 3.1, they are stored under the `webhooks` resource.

Bump.sh can use its resources to group the display of operations in your documentation. You can also use [tags](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#tag-object), which are used, among other things, to group operations by resource and should be added to your API definition.

## Group operations by path (endpoints)

When group operations by path is chosen, Bump.sh deduce endpoint name from related path. First part of the path is extracted to generate the endpoint name, and every operation related to this endpoint name will be grouped together.

## Group operations by tag

> If first level field `tags` are present at the [root of your OpenAPI document object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.3.md#openapi-object), Bump.sh will use `Group by tags` as a default documentation generation behaviour.
{: .info}

When group operation by tag is selected, Bump.sh will use the [`tags`](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#tag-object) from your API definition to group, name and sort operations.

Tags offer you better customization of your documentation, going beyond the resource names. You can also add a description for each tag, which will appear in the header of your documentation.

> When `Group operations by tag` is selected, operations without tags will be ignored and won't be displayed.
